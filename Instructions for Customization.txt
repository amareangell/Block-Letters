Detailed Instructions for Customization

Understand the Structure:

Each line in std::cout corresponds to a row in your block letter design.
Spaces ( ) represent empty parts of the block, while characters like A or S form the visible parts.
Modify the Block Letters:

If you'd like to display your initials or other words, replace the ASCII art in each line.
For example, to create the letter "C":

std::cout << "  CCC  \n";
std::cout << " C     \n";
std::cout << "C      \n";
std::cout << "C      \n";
std::cout << " C     \n";
std::cout << "  CCC  \n";
Add More Letters:

Add std::cout statements to form additional block letters or words.
Example for adding "U":

std::cout << "U     U \n";
std::cout << "U     U \n";
std::cout << "U     U \n";
std::cout << " U   U  \n";
std::cout << "  UUU   \n";
Compile and Run:

Save the file and compile it using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or an IDE like Visual Studio).
Run the compiled program to see the output in the console.
